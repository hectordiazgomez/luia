        "answer": "I agree that children should be banned from eating fast food at school for two important reasons. First, fast food is detrimental to children's health. For instance, fast food is often packed with fat, sugar, salt, and preservatives which makes them extremely unhealthy for children health. In addition, schools should stop from serving fast food it is very expensive. It is a well-known fact that fresh food from a supermarket is significantly cheaper than pre-made fast food. To conclude, for reasons presented above, I believe it is vital that schools stop serving fast food to their students."

        "answer": "Nowadays, most people agree that the telephone has had a tremendous impact on our lives. First of all, phones have evolved over time, and now almost every person on Earth carries one wherever they go. I still remember when I worked in an office in Osaka and they gave me a company phone. I had to be available all day, everyday. One day I went to the movie theater with my girlfriend at the time and the phone rang right in the middle of the film. I did not want to get fired, so I had to take the call and ruin the movie for everyone in the theater. I felt like a dog on a leash, so I quit. Unfortunately, I have had other jobs where I also had to carry a phone with me at all times. While the car and microwave have impacted our world today, no other invention can quite match the massive effect the telephone has had on our lives."
